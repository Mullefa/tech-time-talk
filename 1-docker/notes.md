## What is Docker?

[_From the docs:_](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/) 

- Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. 
- __Docker Engine__ is a client-server application with three major components:
    - A server
    - A REST API 
    - A command line interface (CLI)

- A Docker __Image__ is a set of instructions for creating a Docker container.
- A Docker __Container__ is a runnable instance of an image.
- A Docker __Registry__ stores Docker images
